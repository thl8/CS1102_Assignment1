   <h2>About Us</h2>
   <h3>Project Topic</h3>
   <p>How the computer represent floating-point numbers</p>
   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>We are students from City University of Hong Kong. Since floating-point numbers are extensively utilized in
      mathematics and computer science, engineers need to have an excellent grasp of how computers display these
      numbers. Floating-point numbers are extensively used in computer science to represent real numbers. However, due
      to the limited precision of floating-point values, rounding mistakes can arise when real numbers are represented
      on a computer. This can result in unexpected findings and even calculation errors. For engineers, understanding it
      completely can ensure that the computations are accurate. Therefore, learning how computer represent it will be
      immensely useful as we learn to code. For instance, when learning how to use programming to generate random
      numbers for calculating probability, floating-point numbers are heavily used. We can develop more precise and
      effective code if we have a thorough understanding of floating-point numbers. Furthermore, we can increase method
      optimization and program speed by taking into account the restrictions of floating-point arithmetic.</p>
   <p>While acknowledging that we have many different ways to represent floating-point numbers, we can use 32-bit and
      64-bit single-precision under normalized and de-normalized forms in displaying floating-point numbers in
      computers. To distinguish 32 and 64-bit, we could look into the number of bits contained in the exponent and
      fraction of the definition in binary forms. </p>
   <p>What is more, we learnt some interesting and valuable programming skills by ourselves experiment. For instance,
      adding some emojis to our website and animating some words. Emojis are an increasingly popular way to add
      personality, and learning how to utilize them successfully is essential in today's world. Learning how to add word
      animations to our website, which can be a wonderful method to bring attention to essential information and make
      our content more interactive. Making our own website provides us with an excellent opportunity to experiment with
      new coding techniques.</p>
   <p>As binary numbers are used in representation, understanding how computer display floating-point numbers are
      important when learning computer science. After learning about the 2 main ways, 32 and 64-bit single-precision, in
      representing floating-point numbers, it would be an important foundation for us to learn deeper in computer
      science.</p>
